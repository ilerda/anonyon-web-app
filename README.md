## Visualise public survey data ##

This web app takes publicly available data from YouGov and visualises it in an intuitive way. No need to slog through walls of numbers and text that cannot easily be understood.

An extra level of richness is added by combining the opinion data with socioeconomic and demographic background data. This means the user can easily find correlations between which kind of answers are given by certain demographic groups. For example: What age groups do people who vote for answer A typically fall into? This is easily visualised in another bar chart.

The app runs on a Google Firebase backend. Additional libraries used are Bootstrap, Chart.js, jQuery.
